## Andrés Felipe Rincón Gamboa

Hi, I was born in Colombia and moved to Canada when I was a teenager. I have a degree in software engineering from the faculty of Engineering and a minor in Computer Science at McGill university . I speak Spanish, English, and French. I like to learn about software engineering technologies and find their applications. In my free time I like to play soccer, I do road biking, and I practice judo. In the content below, you can find some of the projects I have done and more info about me. Thank you!

## Portfolio

In my free time, I like to explore new software technologies, learn them, and find applications to them by coding software applications. These are some of my projects: 

#### Natural Language Application 
Source code: [Link](https://github.com/AndresFelipeRG/NaturalLanguageApplicationGoogleAPI)

Created a web application that retrieves financial data from the IEX platform. This application uses Google’s Natural Language API  to score financial news. Scores are logged into a Google Cloud Datastore instance. The application provides an interface that displays financial news sentiment scores.

Technologies covered: Java, SapUI5/OpenUI5, Google Cloud Platform, Hibernate, Spring, Java, HTML, JSON, XML, Maven, Git, CSS, jQuery/JavaScript, Google Datastore.

### Unity Games
These are some of the video games I have developed using the Unity platform and the programming language C#:

- Tic-Tac-Toe unity game(Play on full screen size):[Link](https://andresfeliperg.github.io/TicTacUnityGame/)
- 2D Side-Scrolling game: [Link](https://andresfeliperg.github.io/UnityGame2D/)
