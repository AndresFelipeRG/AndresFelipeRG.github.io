## Andrés Felipe Rincón Gamboa

Hi, I was born in Colombia and moved to Canada when I was a teenager. I have a degree in software engineering from the faculty of Engineering at McGill university. I speak Spanish, English, and French. I like to learn about software engineering technologies and find their applications. In my free time I like to play soccer, I do road biking, and I practice judo. In the content below, you can find some of the projects I have done and more info about me. Thank you!

## Portfolio

In my free time, I like to explore new software technologies, learn them, and find applications to them by coding software applications. These are some of my projects: 

#### Natural Language Application 

Created a web application that retrieves financial data from the IEX platform. This application uses Google’s Natural Language API  to score financial news. Scores are logged into a Google Cloud Datastore instance. The application provides an interface that displays financial news sentiment scores.

Technologies covered: Java, SapUI5/OpenUI5, Google Cloud Platform, Hibernate, Spring, Java, HTML, JSON, XML, Maven, Git, CSS, jQuery/JavaScript, Google Datastore.

#### Video Game platform 

Created a web application that provides access to video games. Each video game was built using the Unity platform. Users access a video game through an interface built with the SapUI5 framework.

Technologies covered: Unity, WebGL, C#, SapUI5/OpenUI5, JSON, XML, HTML, Git, CSS, jQuery/JavaScript

## Education

#### McGill university
I completed a Bachelor of Engineering at McGill university. I completed a major in Software Engineering and Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, I enjoyed all my engineering, science, design project, and management courses. My extracurricular activities were soccer intramurals and judo at McGill university.

#### Laval university
I completed 2 terms at Laval university in Electrical Engineering.
